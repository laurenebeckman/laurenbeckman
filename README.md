Hi, I’m @laurenebeckman. thanks for being here--it's good to see you! :P

✨ I am a spunky chemical engineer and law student who's curious about in energy, tech, business, and law.

🚀 I also like doing sidequests. (On here are some of them.) 

📖 every so often, I remember to write about them on my substack, but... currently I read (a lot), so I tend to post on X instead. 

📱 I'll get back to writing soon, but for now you can check out my social links and see what I'm usually up to. 

❔ that's all about me! what about you? if this sounds cool, lmk you saw this and let's connect. 

thanks again, and see you around.
